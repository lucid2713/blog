## Performance 'Ritual for the Digital World'

Since I didn't get proper video recording of my last performance at Winter Wel Vaart festival, I made a new demo video recording.
This idea started from the winter solstive festival, I would like to further this project.

In this digital era, we can experience all the different ritual ceremonies from various cultural area through online. The physical border between countries are vague for digital generation. On the web, we are now identifying ourselves based on digital culture rather than regional culture and nationality.
<br>
Therefore as digital cosmopolitan, we would need a new way of ceremony, which is border-less, no limit on time and space and connected through web by using bits and atoms.
