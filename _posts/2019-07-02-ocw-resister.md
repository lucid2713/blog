## RE#SISTER: Testing the Waters
### Three days of sound/art festival at OCW in Rotterdam

I became a member of RE#SISTER, a Rotterdam base female/femme/non-binary electronic music and sound community.

As I live far from Rotterdam, I could not participate in resister's events often. But this time there was an interesting showcase 'Testing the Waster' happened at OCW(sound/performance venue) from 28 - 30 June.
After finishing my graduation show, I went there on 29th, and joined a gig 'noise ensemble' with other people.

There were a variety of sound performances as well as installations during the festival. I could be there only one day. However, I really enjoyed playing my e-waste instruments with other people. Also really happy to meet other members!

These are some pics I took in the venue.
