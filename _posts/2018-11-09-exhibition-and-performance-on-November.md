## Exhibitions and Performances of my work 'Playful Obsolescence' in Fall 2018

### Exhibition
I had 2 group exhibitions with my work in progress 'Playful Obsolescence' on November 2018. One took place at Ujeongguk in Seoul, Korea and another was at SIGN gallery in Groningen, Netherlands.
<br><br>

#### Exhibition Forking Room:Your Smart Neighborhood
The Exhibition [Forking Room: Your Smart Neighborhood](http://ujeongguk.com/forking-room/) was held by [Unmake Lab](http://www.unmakelab.org/) as a research project. The theme of forking room is associated with today's society, technology and art. This year's forking room consisted of exhibition, talk, lecture and workshop. I participated the exhibition as one of artists with the video documentation of my e-waste instrument.

#### Exhibition Terzetto
From 3th to 25th of November, I had another group exhibition at [SIGN gallery](https://sign2.nl/) in Groningen, Netherlands. The exhibition took place during the *Sound of Music* festival in Groningen so that the gallery invited 3 young artists who are working on sound related art.
<br>
I presented my e-waste instruments and the video documentation, and had sound performances at opening(on 9th) and closing(25th) events. For both performances, Lucija Gregov joined with her cello. (As we perform together as experimental sound project *fruit from the forest*.)

### Performance and Presentation

#### Performance at TutTotTud festival
As [Fruit From the Forest](https://fruitfromtheforest.com), I had a performance at [Tut Tot Tud festival](https://www.tuttottud.com/), together with Lucija. Like as we did at opening of exhibition Terzetto, I played my e-waste instruments with live video, and Lucija played her cello and some digital pieces she made.

#### Presentation at Instruments Make Play Fair
I participated [Instruments Make Play Fair](https://instrumentsmakeplay.nl/8-december-2018-instruments-make-play-fair-in-worm-rotterdam/) on 8th December. Last year's instruments make fair festival, I joined a workshop(analog synthesizer building by Nataliya Petkova at STEIM, Amsterdam), but this year I was there as an instrument builder!
<br>
During the fair, I gave a short presentation and performance on my work. There were lots of interesting self-made instruments made by awesome artists and makers. And I had really good time in there, meeting and having conversation with visitors as well as other artists.
