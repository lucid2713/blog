## Let's build more circuits with e-waste

*to be updated*

### metal detector
While reading *A Geology of Media* by Jussi Parikka, I got to know that one of important recycling process at e-waste dumpsite is to excavate and sort out metal from all broken the parts. So I searched how we can detect metals and found there are quite easy ways to make DIY metal detector! Mostly this metal detector works with amplifier chip in order to make sounds when it detects metal. This is also very cool for me as I've been generating sounds from e-waste so far.

Thus I decided to make a metal detector, the materials to make it would be from e-waste, and then use it to detect and find metals from e-waste. I thought not only it could be useful but also it could be very playful.
I could see several thick coils(made from copper) among my e-waste, which is needed for metal detector. So I took one out from a complicated looking board and made a circuit with amp chip and this coil.

In this video you can see how it works.

However, I realized I need more thinker and bigger coil for better performance. Also the little magnetic speaker in the video has very strong magnetic field so the metal detector could clearly recognize it. But for the little metals which are all scattered and attached on my e-waste heap, it wouldn't work. Maybe I will try to find more bigger coil from my e-waste and make it again.

Nevertheless, this metal detector could be another possible instruments!


### sorting out e-waste
I decided to make as many circuit instruments as I can from now on. This time I would try with several different oscillator chips together with any kinds of possible components from e-waste(resistor, capacitor, leds, buttons etc).
