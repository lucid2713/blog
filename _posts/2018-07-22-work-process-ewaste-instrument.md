## Research, Making and Performing with E-Waste  


### Pilot Research
I started my e-waste research since last September(2017). At the beginning, I've been searching for information, art works and artists related to e-waste and then, made a mind map with the resources.

<br>

### Collecting Materials
While researching information, I also started to collect electronic waste around the city, consisting of broken computer parts, lots of wires, deceased cellphone etc. I do appreciate my kind colleagues to bring me e-waste whenever they find something around themselves.

### Tinkering with e-waste
After some theoretical research, I started to tinker with my materials to 'make' something with them.
<br><br>
**The Future, Outdated**
<br>
As the first trial, I made an installation composed of electronic waste. It was exhibited at Orbit Fest, on Decemver, 2017. <br>

**Performance at Het Rumoer festival**
<br>
In collaboration with a cellist, Lucija, I had a performance with my analog synthesizer and e-waste installation, which was modified and added interaction with servo, using Arduino, MaxMSP and contact microphone. We performed at Het Rumoer festival on April, 2018. The microphone was attached to the cello, and according to the input that mic received from cello, not only the video on the installation but also the sound of cello were modulated and distorted.

**Feedback Session on March**
<br>
During the feedback session of my class on March, 2018, I presented the work in progress of my e-waste instrument research.

### Handmade Electronic Music
After the [workshop 'Electricity Matters'](http://lucid2713.github.io/blog/articles/2017-12/Electricity-Matters-workshop) last November at STEIM, I've been interested in playing with circuits in order to make instruments (and related stuffs). While keep exploring with circuits and analog synth, I came up with an idea that combining circuit instruments with e-waste to make an instrument.
#### What I've made so far :

### Upcoming plan
* how to develop (sequencer, field kit)
* zine (process of work / how to)
* design plan (handy-drum, modular ...)
* material for instrument's shield / box (industrial hemp)
