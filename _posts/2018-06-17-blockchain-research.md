I started ‘Artistic Research on Blockchain’ for Research & Art Practices B(RAPB) course in FMI.

Basically, my plan is to study Blockchain, Cryptocurrency and related issues, and to research the artistic discourse and practices on it. I would like to find how to exploit and play with this notable technology for my work. In relation to my work, a design mockup or prototype will be come out as an outcome of this research.

### After the assessment

After the final assessment of my 1st-year in Master's course on 26th June 2018, in looking back my initial ideas and what I've achieved together with comment and critics from my tutors, I had to rethink and redesign this blockchain research.

#### Reflection
I couldn't make my research proposal up to the state what I've planned before. I was planning to focus on one of features in the are&blockchain world and to make some prototype related to both blockchain technology and my current work(e-waste), but only could look through generally.

My research question was still vary opened and vague, and I couldn't decide yet the specific interested area in the world of are&blockchain. My tutors also pointed out this, and I do agree with their point that I'm wondering in the blockchain labyrinth without a clear point of view for my masters' thesis. Tutors advised me not to disturb myself too much with too many interests that I have. And honestly, that's kind of my strength as well as weakness, but it seems to become the bad one at this moment.

No doubt blockchain became really expectational matter in the art and will be more boosted continually. However, to make a connection with my thesis seems to be too imprecise at the moment and too much times needed to dive into further. Franky speaking, it will take a lot of time only with the e-waste instrument making within 1 year until my master's study ends.

Thus I have to consider whether to leave it as an extra research for my hobby or to find the proper way to combine with my work. At the moment, I'm leaning toward the former, just concentrating on my e-waste instrument development both in practice and theoretical research on itself.
