I started ‘Artistic Reserach on Blockchain’ for individual theoretical project on ‘Art & Media Theory’ course in FMI.

Basically, my plan is studying Blockchain, Cryptocurrency and related issues, and researching the artistic discourse and practices on it. I would like to find how to exploit and play with this notable technology for my work as well as for my future. In relation to my work, a design mockup or prototype will be come out as an outcome of this research.
