## Performance at Stukafest2019 Groningen

I joined a performance together with MADtech colleagues at Stukafest Groningen on the 28th of February.<br>
It was an experimental collaborative audiovisual performance with various media. Each of us put our work in a performative way in one student house in the city.<br>
We made live music, video projection, and installations. I played my e-waste instruments during the performance.
